# URL-SHORTENER FRONTEND

This repos have been created for fixing the Deploying a backend on Vercel (github.com/Pateezai/Shortener), 
So I try to split the repo and depolying it Frontend deploy on Vercel, Backend(github.com/Pateezai/prototype) 
deploy on Render.io (For some reason Backend code cannot deploy on Vercel so i split and do it on render.io) 
And It's work!! 
So this repo is a bit difference from the (Shortener) but mostly are same
